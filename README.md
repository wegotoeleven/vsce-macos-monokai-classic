## Installation

- Follow Markplace guidelines, or
- Launch the command palette, then run the following:

## Credit

This theme is inspired by the default VSCode Dark and Light themes, with adjustments to the activity and title bar colors to better align with macOS light and dark modes. It incorporates Monokai syntax colors, which Iâ€™ve aimed to keep as faithful as possible to [Monokai Classic](https://monokai.pro/vscode).
